config_files
============
A collection of user-level config files for Linux systems. Files and directories are structured as they would be relative to a Linux user's home directory. Use them by symlinking the desired config files to the corresponding files in this collection.


**.bashrc** - Universal bash startup file. Sources ~/.bashrc_local for machine-specific bash startup commands.

**.i3/** - Configuration directory for the i3 window manager.

**.i3status.conf** - Config file for i3 window manager's status line (usually at the bottom of the screen).
