  * if not present, download, install, and configure git
  * create a ~/src directory
  * clone into dotfiles repo
  * download and run oh-my-zsh's installer script
  * clone powerlevel10k in oh-my-zsh's custom themes dir
  * install .p10k.sh
  * install .zshrc
  * install .tmux.conf

On dev machines (local and remote):
  * create an ssh key and dist it to GitHub
  * change dotfiles remove over to ssh-based one

  * install terminal colors and settings
  * download and install ST3
  * activate ST3 license
  * install package control and ST3 packages
